### Abstract
This study examines the integration of construction robotics (CR) and operational efficiency in China’s commercial residential projects (CRPs) through a novel construction robotic-agile success model (CR-ASM). While CR demonstrates subprocess efficiency gains of 15-25%, challenges persist in translating these improvements to overall project performance, emphasizing the critical catalyzing role between technical and managerial factors. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) identifies significant effects of top management commitment (β=0.702, p<0.001) and developer skills (βtechnical=0.227, βsocial=0.077, p<0.05) on project success. Necessary condition analysis confirms that management commitment is a prerequisite for high operational efficiency and project success (consistencies > 0.85). Multigroup analysis revealed significant differences between CR-implemented CRPs and non-CR-implemented CRPs only in terms of management commitment formation, whereas the other constructs were nonsignificant. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used to validate three PLS‒SEM-revealed paths and uncover six possible paths to improve performance, all of which require sustained management commitment with varying technical‒managerial configurations. The findings demonstrate that successful CR implementation requires synergistic coupling of technical capabilities with organizational factors. These insights offer actionable guidance for policymakers to develop targeted regulatory strategies and for industry professionals to align technical capabilities with management strategies, bridging the gap between subprocess and overall efficiency. This study advances theory by coupling technology-organization-environment (TOE) components with agile project management (APM) principles while providing evidence-based guidance for optimizing CRP operational efficiency in a standardized residential development context.
